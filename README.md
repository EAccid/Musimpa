**Musimpa** is a practice Android project built to improve my skills in Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and app architecture (MVVM, Jetpack Navigation, ViewModel).

The goal is to explore UI state management, screen navigation, background work with WorkManager, and write unit/UI tests using Android tools and best practices.  
This project works with the free [TMDb API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to fetch movie data and display it in the app.
